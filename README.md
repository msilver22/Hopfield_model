This colab delves into the **Hopfield Neural Network Model**.


---


The exploration begins with an overview of the model's foundations, incorporating insights from mechanical statistics to deepen our understanding. Focusing on **Audio Retrieval**, the code shows the Hopfield model's associative memory capabilities. In particular,the network will be trained to retrieve different patterns.
